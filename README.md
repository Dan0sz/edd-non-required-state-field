# Non-required Card State Field for Easy Digital Downloads

Dynamically detect if State should be a required field, based on the selected Country.

For any country with a predefined list of states, e.g. US and CA, the State field is a required field. For any other
country, where the State field is a text box, it becomes a non-required entry.
